This is a short R code used to make the first data cleaning assuming the following:
1. We'll analyze only the journeys considered to be real and that 
  - start_at: datetime when the rider requests the vehicle 
  - arrived_at: datetime when the driver arrives to the meeting point to pick up the rider. This should be greater than or at least equal to the "start_at" datetime
  - end_at: datetime when the journey is ended. This should be greater than or at least equal to the "arrived_at" datetime
